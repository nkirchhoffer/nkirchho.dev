**Welcome to my new blog !**

Writing is one of my favorite hobbies, and, with the use of writing my ideas and projects down, I decided to put my personal blog back on tracks !

On this website, you will mainly find :
* Opiniated articles on the IT industry (mainly in France)
* Articles on technologies
* Projects on which I am working

Like every portfolio, personal website and technical blog out there, some of my articles will be cross-published on external websites like [dev.to](https://dev.to) and some RSS feeds, so don't worry if you find some of my articles on [daily.dev](https://daily.dev) :)

## By the way, how does your blog work ?

It's quite simple actually. Well, it hasn't always been the case. Many years ago, I developed my first blog using Laravel, PHP and MySQL, you know, the classical stuff. It was a great experience, and to this day, I don't regret it one bit. But, it became quickly a mess to maintain and keep up to date, which was my major problem with my websites back in the day. 

For this instance of the website, I decided to look down and seek simplicity. In 2022, it has become important to me to host simple services and write un-bloated code. To achieve this goal, I went down the rabbit hole of the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org) and chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as the "backend" for this website.

Hugo is a framework that is using "Static Site Generating" (SSG) technologies to translate Markdown syntax in HTML/CSS layouts with themes, functions at build, and all that good stuff.

No database, no Java, no PHP in the way to give the maintainers headaches. But I will definitely be writing about that some time later!

By the way, this website is fully open-source and you can retrieve its source code there : [https://github.com/nkirchhoffer/nkirchho.dev](https://github.com/nkirchhoffer/nkirchho.dev)
